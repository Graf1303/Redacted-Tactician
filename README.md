This repo is an idea that I had when I was lfirst learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
My idea was to create a single page that was a "menu" for when you go visit a firearms range and are wanting to select a firearm to rent.
In it, would be the type of firearm, the cost of the rental, cost of the ammunition as well as cost of the range rental.
